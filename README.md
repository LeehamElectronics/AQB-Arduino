# Automated Quad Bike: Arduino Software
### School Assessed Task: Systems Engineering
![GitHub Logo](media/AQB-AC-GitHub-Logo.png)

## üåÖ Overview
This project is developed by Liam Price in order to pass the Systems Engineering SAT at BSSC. The overall function of this software is to be uploaded onto Arduino based boards to control and drive the systems involved in my Systems Engineering Project "Automated Quad Bike" or AQB for short. You may use this software and adapt it for your own IoT project if you like.

Here is the repository for the Python Control Panel software: [Control Panel](https://github.com/LeehamElectronics/AQB-Control-Panel)

Here is a YouTube video with a basic demonstration of the system: [YouTube Video](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLkjjbXy1enZJepPcc3pw2ZweEczIi7GO)
